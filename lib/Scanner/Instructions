Put the dart files into lib as normal 
put the images in a new folder you create and call "images" 
Do not change the name of the iamges otherwise it won't work. 

Add these two in dependencies: 

image_picker: ^0.8.5+3
simple_animations: ^1.3.3

And this in "assets": (still in the yaml file) 
    - lib/images/
